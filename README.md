# evoked_LFP_rat_barrel_cortex

This repository contains the codes for extracting features from evoked local field potentials recorded from rat barrel cortex.

The project was my master thesis project at ETH Zurich in 2018. It was in collaboration with University of Padua, which provided us with the data.

You can find the outcome of this project in two publications:

```
X. Wang et al., "Rat Cortical Layers Classification extracting Evoked Local Field Potential Images with Implanted Multi-Electrode Sensor," 2018 IEEE 20th International Conference on e-Health Networking, Applications and Services (Healthcom), 2018, pp. 1-6, doi: 10.1109/HealthCom.2018.8531084.
```
available on [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8531084) and on [ETHZ Research Collection](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/337441). It received an excellent paper award.
